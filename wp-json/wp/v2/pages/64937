No matter the device you choose, you'll get full access to every feature. The main difference is that the iPad app lets your employees take the entire point of sale system with them anywhere in store to assist customers, transforming the shopping experience.<br \/>\r\n<br \/>\r\nLightspeed Restaurant POS users must use the iPad app to access ordering functionalities, however, the backend manager can be accessed on both an iPad and a desktop computer. This enables waitstaff to enter orders from anywhere in the restaurant (table, bar or terrace) and send them directly to the kitchen with one tap."},{"faq_question":"How do the desktop and iPad versions differ?","faq_answer":"Lightspeed Retail is an all-in-one system, no matter the device you're on. The desktop version enables backend management and point of sale functionalities. The iPad POS system can be used alongside a desktop computer for both point of sale and most backend management functionalities. <br \/>\r\n<br \/>\r\nLike Retail, Lightspeed Restaurant is an all-in-one system, no matter the device you're using; the difference is the level of access you have to the ePOS depending on the device you're using. The desktop version is used to manage your backend only, from menus to floor plans and employee roles. The iPad app was designed to manage your front of house, such as taking orders, but can also let you manage the backend."},{"faq_question":"Can I use an iPad as a second register?","faq_answer":"Lightspeed Retail plans include one register as default, but you can add extra registers to your plan by contacting your sales representative. Your registers don't all need to run on the same device\u2014you can have both desktop computers and iPads running at the same time.<br \/>\r\n<br \/>\r\nFor Lightspeed Restaurant, every iPad registered to your account needs to be linked to a physical cash drawer. Note that if an iPad you\u2019re using is not connected to a corresponding cash drawer, all payments taken through it will be deposited in a virtual cash drawer automatically associated to the user logged in to the device. However you decide to manage this, any iPad associated to your account can be used as an extra register."},{"faq_question":"Which version of iPad do I need?","faq_answer":"In order to use Lightspeed Retail or Lightspeed Restaurant on an iPad, you must have a version capable of supporting iOS 12.2 or higher.
