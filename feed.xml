<h2 id="section1"><b>What is restaurant financing?</b></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Restaurant financing refers to any form of outside funding that business owners secure to support a range of business needs. This could be a bank loan, funds from family and friends, investors or other lending sources. </span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2 id="section2"><b>Why do restaurants apply for financing?</b></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">There’s a host of reasons why restaurant owners and finance teams look for funding in the first place.</span></p>
<ol>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Starting a new business</span></li>

<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Funding operational expenses</span></li>
</ol>
<h3><b>Starting a new business</b></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">There are plenty of </span><a href="http://lightspeedhq.com/blog/restaurant-startup-costs/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">startup costs</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> to plan for before a restaurant can open its doors to the public. Owners might need to refurbish premises, update old kitchen equipment, buy furniture and fittings, and invest in menus and staff uniforms. And let’s not forget the need to carefully source that all-important food, alcohol and beverage stock. </span></p>
<h3><b>Renovating an existing location</b></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As successful restaurants evolve, many chefs and owners seek to hire more experienced kitchen staff or redesign their interiors. Interior design trends change rapidly, especially in metropolitan areas. What’s more, busy restaurants can quickly experience wear and tear because of the sheer number of customers coming through the doors each day. While it’s a good problem to have, it does mean regular renovations become a reality.</span></p>
<h3><b>Investing in new equipment</b></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Whether it’s chefs, waitstaff, or baristas—everyone needs the right tools to do their jobs. For this reason, many owners look to equipment financing to help fund the restaurant equipment they’ll need, from coffeemakers, a </span><strong><a href="/pos/restaurant/">POS system</a></strong><span style="font-weight: 400;">, and premium ovens, to grills and stoves. </span></p>
<h3><b>Opening another location</b></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Expansion is another common reason why owners explore their restaurant financing options. Many entrepreneurs have bold plans to grow from a single location into either a chain of city-wide or regional restaurants. Doing so comes with costs related to sourcing new </span><a href="/blog/tips-for-leasing-restaurant-space/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span style="font-weight: 400;">commercial spaces</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, handling renovations or even constructing a new building.</span></p>
<h3><b>Adding more tables to increase covers</b></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">But not all expansion plans need to be so grand. Much like their chefs who carefully add an ingredient here and there to ensure a perfect taste, restaurant owners may look to change their business more slowly. Expanding can involve something as simple as adding space to serve additional ‘covers’ on new tables.</span></p>
<h3><b>Operations, marketing or hiring advice</b></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Restaurant owners have to make many decisions every day, often against the backdrop of the hustle and bustle of a busy restaurant. It’s understandable that many owners choose to get some outside advice. There is an increasing number of consultants—some who own or chef in other restaurants—who have begun to provide advice to other restaurant owners. Such consultants can help with </span><a href="/blog/hiring-a-restaurant-manager/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span style="font-weight: 400;">sourcing managers</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> or sous chefs, give advice about how to position a restaurant in a crowded market or help to improve the overall running of the business.</span></p>
<h3><b>Rebranding</b></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Restaurant-owners know the industry is highly competitive. In fact, many thrive on it. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Still, it can be a challenge for restaurants serving highly popular cuisines—in French bistros, Italian pizzerias, and Japanese ramen spots—to stand out from competitors offering similar dishes and experiences. It’s here where the value of a restaurant’s brand can become a key point of difference. Some restaurant loans are being used to create standout brands or to rebrand traditional venues for emerging culinary and dietary tastes. </span></p>
<h3><b>Diversifying through catering or packaged goods</b></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">One way restaurants can build a strong brand is by continuing customers’ experiences with them beyond the building. Here’s where providing </span><a href="/blog/how-to-start-restaurant-catering-business/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span style="font-weight: 400;">catering services</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> and take-home products can play a part. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Many grills are famous for their steak and rib sauces. Italian restaurants have home-made pasta that’s impossible to recreate yourself. And some Asian restaurants have frozen dumplings that can—for a few fleeting moments—whisk your tastebuds back to that favorite restaurant. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">While providing these goods can provide an additional revenue stream for restaurants, they do come with the costs of product development, packaging and logistics. </span></p>
<h3><b>Funding operational expenses</b></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Seeking funding is not always about growth. On other occasions, owners pursue restaurant funding options to support the day-to-day running of the business. In restaurants where revenue is seasonal—or even unpredictable—some owners may decide to secure funds to support positive cashflow.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2 id="section3"><b>10 restaurant financing options</b></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Now that you’ve learned about some of the reasons for restaurant lending, here are 10 different financing options you can consider:</span></p>
<ol>
<li><b><span style="font-weight: 400;">Brick-and-mortar bank loans</span></b></li>
<li><span style="font-weight: 400;">Alternative loans</span></li>
<li><span style="font-weight: 400;">Small Business Administration loans (SBA)</span></li>
<li><span style="font-weight: 400;">Merchant Cash Advances (MCA)</span></li>
<li><span style="font-weight: 400;">Business line of credit (LOC)</span></li>
<li><span style="font-weight: 400;">Business crowdfunding</span></li>
<li><span style="font-weight: 400;">Loans from friends and family</span></li>
<li><span style="font-weight: 400;">Commercial real estate loan (CRE)</span></li>
<li><span style="font-weight: 400;">Equipment financing</span></li>
<li><span style="font-weight: 400;">Purchase order financing</span></li>
</ol>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Let’s look at the pros and cons of all 10 options for sourcing funds. </span></p>
<h3><b>1. Brick-and-mortar bank loans</b></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Let’s start with probably the most well-known option: your bank. Traditional banks have been lending to small to mid-sized businesses for a very long time. Their systems are established, rigorous and proven. Let’s take a quick look at the pros and cons of seeking finance through a bank.</span></p>

<h5><b>Pros</b></h5>

<td><span style="font-weight: 400;">The loan can be tailored to operational needs</span></td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>
<h3><b>2. Alternative loans</b></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Understandably, not every restaurant owner has the time or occasionally the credit history to secure funding from a brick-and-mortar lender. In these situations, loans for restaurants can be pursued with a number of alternative lenders. Here are some points you might want to consider when looking into an alternative loan option. </span></p>

<td><span style="font-weight: 400;">Some lenders have short track records</span></td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>
<h3><b>3. Small Business Administration (SBA) Loans</b></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As </span><a href="https://www.sba.gov/video-series/financing#372761" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span style="font-weight: 400;">this video explains</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, SBA loans help existing small businesses when they can&#8217;t get financing from other sources or without an SBA guarantee for the lender. The SBA does not fund these loans directly. It guarantees banks it will repay a portion of the loan if a business defaults.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">SBA loans may be used to buy land or equipment, buy an existing business, refinance existing debt, or purchase machinery, furniture, fixtures, supplies or materials. </span></p>
<table>
<tbody>
<tr>
<td colspan="2">
<h4><b>Is an SBA loan right for your restaurant? </b></h4>
</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>
<h4><b>Pros</b></h4>
</td>
<td>
<h4><b>Cons</b></h4>
</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><span style="font-weight: 400;">Government-guaranteed for up to $5 million</span></td>
<td><span style="font-weight: 400;">Suitable for profitable businesses only</span></td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><span style="font-weight: 400;">Long-term financing (for up to 25 years)</span></td>
<td><span style="font-weight: 400;">Must also have owner equity to invest</span></td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><span style="font-weight: 400;">The SBA bans many common loan fees</span></td>
<td><span style="font-weight: 400;">Eligibility is tightly defined</span></td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>
<h3><b>4. Merchant Cash Advance (MCA)</b></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Technically not a loan, a merchant cash advance (MCA) is a way for restaurants to receive funds against future payments that will be made through their merchant payment system. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">This can be useful for restaurants that are processing a high volume of credit card transactions while needing access to funds—fast. However, business owners need to be wary. The high rates of many MCA providers can lead to repayment amounts outstripping the original advance by as much as 40%.</span></p>
<table>
<tbody>
<tr>
<td colspan="2">
<h4><b>Is an MCA right for your restaurant? </b></h4>
</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>
<h4><b>Pros</b></h4>
</td>
<td>
<h4><b>Cons</b></h4>
</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><span style="font-weight: 400;">Quick decision and release of funds</span></td>
<td><span style="font-weight: 400;">Repayments will outstrip borrowed amount</span></td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><span style="font-weight: 400;">Useful for businesses with weak credit scores</span></td>
<td><span style="font-weight: 400;">Does not build credit history</span></td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><span style="font-weight: 400;">Existing merchant account acts as collateral</span></td>
<td><span style="font-weight: 400;">Typically high rates</span></td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>
<h3><b>5. A business line of credit (LOC)</b></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Businesses usually seek out lines of credit through their bank. Many alternative lenders are now offering this option too. In short, a business line of credit allows restaurants to access a set additional amount of funds each, as and when needed.</span></p>
<table>
<tbody>
<tr>
<td colspan="2">
<h4><b> Is a business line of credit (LOC) right for your restaurant? </b></h4>

</tr>
<tr>
<td>
<h4><b>Pros</b></h4>
</td>
<td>
<h4><b>Cons</b></h4>
</td>

<td><span style="font-weight: 400;">Useful for managing cashflow</span></td>
<td><span style="font-weight: 400;">Borrowing amount often capped at low levels</span></td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><span style="font-weight: 400;">You usually only pay interest when it is used</span></td>
<td><span style="font-weight: 400;">Fees need to be judged carefully</span></td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><span style="font-weight: 400;">Can be secured or unsecured</span></td>
<td><span style="font-weight: 400;">Not a long-term solution </span></td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>
<h3><b>6. Crowdfunding</b></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Crowdfunding is the use of small amounts of capital from a large number of individuals to finance a new business venture, </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">according to </span><a href="https://www.investopedia.com/terms/c/crowdfunding.asp" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Investopedia</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Crowdfunding is often used to validate new product ideas or seek funding from early adopters for a new startup idea. It’s less associated with service businesses, particularly restaurants. Still interested? Here are some of the pros and cons. </span></p>
<table>
<tbody>
<tr>
<td colspan="2">
<h4><b>Is crowdfunding right for your restaurant? </b></h4>
</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>
<h4><b>Pros</b></h4>
</td>
<td>
<h4><b>Cons</b></h4>
</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><span style="font-weight: 400;">Useful for testing new ideas quickly</span></td>
<td><span style="font-weight: 400;">Not suited to longterm needs</span></td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><span style="font-weight: 400;">It can double as PR and marketing</span></td>
<td><span style="font-weight: 400;">Not typically suited to restaurants</span></td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><span style="font-weight: 400;">It can attract other forms of investment</span></td>
<td><span style="font-weight: 400;">The process is highly public</span></td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>
<h3><b>7. Friends and family</b></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">If you’ve been running a restaurant for a number of years, your friends and family are likely some of your biggest supporters. They may have backed you as a business owner and dug into their own pockets, as your earliest, and subsequently most loyal patrons. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It makes sense then. This is why many business owners choose to ask parents, siblings, partners and friends for financing. They can help chefs and restaurant-owners get working capital through a loan without a credit check. Just remember: mixing professional and personal relationships can become complicated.</span></p>
<table>
<tbody>
<tr>
<td colspan="2">
<h4><b> Is a loan from family and friends right for your restaurant? </b></h4>
</td>

<tr>
<td>
<h4><b>Pros</b></h4>
</td>
<td>
<h4><b>Cons</b></h4>
</td>

<tr>
<td><span style="font-weight: 400;">No paperwork or lengthy approvals</span></td>

<td><span style="font-weight: 400;">Potential for legal disputes</span></td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>
<h3><b>8. Commercial real estate loan (CRE)</b></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Commercial real estate isn’t getting cheaper any time soon. Restaurateurs can tap into commercial real estate (CRE) loans to improve buildings, parking lots, gardens, and more. Some lenders, particularly those participating in </span><a href="https://www.sba.gov/content/u-s-small-business-administration-loan-funds-available-purchase-commercial-real-estate" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span style="font-weight: 400;">SBA schemes</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, may allow borrowers to include architectural and legal fees, appraisals and other construction costs within a loan. </span></p>
<div style="background-color: #f7f7f7; line-height: 1.45; font-size: 1.125rem; margin-top: 30px; margin-bottom: 30px; border: 1px solid #e9e9eb; border-radius: 4px; padding: 30px 20px 30px 20px;"><b>Editor’s note: </b><span style="font-weight: 400;">We have skipped the pros and cons here. That’s because,</span> <span style="font-weight: 400;">if you’re</span> <span style="font-weight: 400;">seriously considering a commercial real estate (CRE) loan, it may be best to speak to your accountant or a trusted financial adviser. CRE loans are very different than residential real estate mortgages, for example. Speaking to an advisor may help you better understand how CRE loans are assessed and structured differently for restaurants of various sizes. </span></div>
<h3><b>9. Equipment financing</b></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Restaurants often need to fund things like coffee-makers, POS technology, premium ovens, grills and stoves. This is where equipment financing can help. Here are its pros and cons. </span></p>
<table>
<tbody>
<tr>
<td colspan="2">
<h4><b>  Is equipment financing right for your restaurant? </b></h4>

<h4><b>Pros</b></h4>
</td>
<td>
<h4><b>Cons</b></h4>

<tr>
<td><span style="font-weight: 400;">The equipment acts as collateral </span></td>
<td><span style="font-weight: 400;">Can be less flexible than leasing</span></td>

</tr>
<tr>
<td><span style="font-weight: 400;">You eventually own the equipment</span></td>
<td><span style="font-weight: 400;">Equipment may become redundant</span></td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>
<h3><b>10. Purchase order (PO) financing</b></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As every business owner knows, orders are often received and completed long before they are paid for. You probably know this only too well, if your restaurant offers a catering service, for example. </span><a href="/blog/purchase-orders/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Purchase order (PO)</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> financing can be a useful option for restaurants that don’t have enough cash flow to complete outstanding orders. </span></p>

<h2 id="section4"><b>6 ways to evaluate restaurant financing and loans</b></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As you can see, the funding options we’ve looked at vary widely. Here’s what to do next, if you’ve started to hone in on some possible options from the list above. Take the following steps when assessing each option:</span></p>
<ol>
<li><b><span style="font-weight: 400;">Check how quickly you get your capital</span></b></li>
<li><span style="font-weight: 400;">Evaluate total repayments </span></li>
<li><span style="font-weight: 400;">Compare the term of the loan</span></li>
<li><span style="font-weight: 400;">Compare the benefits of fixed vs. variable rates</span></li>
<li><span style="font-weight: 400;">Find out of collateral is needed</span></li>
<li><span style="font-weight: 400;">Review the lender’s reputation</span></li>
</ol>
<h2><b>Your financing and loans fit</b></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Taking a step to expand or support your restaurant business can be equal parts exciting and nervy. Ultimately, you’ll know best which is the right option for your business as you continue to look into funding sources. </span></p>

We compiled industry stats and data from our very own retailers to paint a picture of the retail industry today from a Lightspeed perspective. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Our retail year in review report will give you a quick recap of how sporting goods and health and beauty retailers fared in 2019, comparing Lightspeed merchants to overall industry sales benchmarks.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">To make sense of the data, we partnered with </span><a href="https://retailminded.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Retail Minded</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Founder Nicole Leinbach Reyhle for her expert opinion. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Let’s dive in! </span></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2><b>Taking the industry by storm </b></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The retail industry is constantly changing, which can make staying on top of the latest trends or even keeping your business stable a challenge. The constant battle between e-commerce and brick-and-mortar makes 2019 a year of transformation for retail, increasing the importance of shifting to an omnichannel strategy. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">While many are concerned with the closures of brick-and-mortar stores around the world, according to Forbes, physical stores </span><a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/jiawertz/2018/11/28/5-trends-that-will-redefine-retail-in-2019/#677357636526" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span style="font-weight: 400;">still play a key role </span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">in the sales process, now becoming part of a broader retail strategy. Omnichannel is becoming more and more vital for retailers looking to acquire new customers. As retailers begin adopting this type of strategy, providing customers with the right customer service remained one of the challenges to overcome in 2019. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Original forecasts called for retail sales to increase between </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">3.8% and 4.4% to <a href="https://nrf.com/insights/economy/state-retail" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">more than 3.8 million</a></span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> in 2019. Amidst big industry changes and struggles, including the growth of e-commerce retailers and exit of well known big-name stores, the retail industry remained stable in 2019, without significant dips or leaps in growth. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Lightspeed merchants, on the other hand, saw growth across North America like never before. Our American retailers </span><b>grew four times faster </b><span style="font-weight: 400;">than the industry average, while our Canadian retailers took it a step further by </span><b>growing six times faster </b><span style="font-weight: 400;">than the industry! </span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2><b>Not your average retailer</b></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">When it comes to our customers’ stellar growth this year, Nicole explained that “there are so many factors that are going to influence a retailer’s operation, but when you have a technology partner that is able to shift, respond, react and support you in all the complex touchpoints, you are better positioned to be successful.” </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Our customers are the best in the business. Many Lightspeed customers are early adopters with sophisticated business needs, which means they’re constantly looking for the best tools to help them accomplish their goals. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">According to Nicole, most retailers are complex, but “many retailers don’t recognize their complexity.” Our customers understand the need to find the right solutions to help them make the intricate aspects of their business manageable. </span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2><b>Winning across verticals</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> </span></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In our retail year in review report, we also took a look at some of our verticals and their performance in North America compared to the industry. Our retailers outperformed the industry in sectors like electronics, fashion, sporting goods, health and beauty as well as home and garden. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Our big winners this year? Health and beauty and sporting goods. </span></p>
<h3><b>Health and beauty took home retail gold</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> </span></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Currently valued at </span><a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/pamdanziger/2019/09/01/6-trends-shaping-the-future-of-the-532b-beauty-business/#5b69e8fd588d" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span style="font-weight: 400;">$532 billion</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, the health and beauty industry has been sky-rocketing in recent years. With major celebrity brands like Kylie Jenner’s Kylie Cosmetics propelling the industry forward, it’s not a surprise that this industry is doing more than well. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In 2019, our health and beauty retailers grew sales by a stunning 23.8% compared to 2018. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The </span><span style="font-weight: 400;"><a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/beauty-multibillion-industry-trends-future-2019-7" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">rise of beauty vloggers and influencer marketing</a>, as well as the incorporation of shoppable ads within social media giants like Instagram and Pinterest,</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> are some of the reasons behind the growth of the industry. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">This growth has attracted other players too. Brands from other verticals have started to notice the opportunity and want a piece of the pie. Lululemon, traditionally an athleisure apparel retailer, is now entering the health and beauty sector, with the introduction of their collection of self-care products. </span></p>
<h4><b>A shift in customer preferences</b></h4>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">One of the bigger shifts within the industry? The need for </span><a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/pamdanziger/2019/09/01/6-trends-shaping-the-future-of-the-532b-beauty-business/#56c943dc588d" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span style="font-weight: 400;">a real-world, hands-on experience</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. Customers are craving interaction and want to experience products first hand. While brands like Glossier grew and thrived in the e-commerce ecosystem, they’ve found themselves incorporating brick-and-mortar into their arsenal in recent years. This shift demonstrates the importance of knowing your customers and how having brick-and-mortar and e-commerce provides the necessary balance retailers need. Something our Lightspeed retailers have been able to achieve. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">With Lightspeed, our retailers can take advantage of different tools like reporting and loyalty programs to really understand what their customers are buying, create bundles and motivate them with exclusive deals and personalized messaging, ultimately helping them increase their average basket value and size. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Nicole’s tip for you? Other sectors can also take advantage of this boom in health and beauty. “The <b>growth of health and beauty</b> is actually exciting for other industries because it falls into an upsell opportunity. Fashion retailers could introduce health and beauty add-ons into their mix to help <b>boost basket size and overall sales</b>.” </span></p>
<h3><b>Sporting goods sold like never before</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> </span></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Sporting goods are our next star vertical. This sector has seen many changes in recent years, with the lines between sportswear and casual wear becoming more and more blurred and new health trends coming into the picture. Our retailers took advantage of the latest consumer trends and put them to work.  </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">This year Lightspeed sporting goods stores increased their average transactions by 22.3% compared to 2018. </span></p>
<h4><b>A changing industry</b></h4>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">When it comes to growth, sporting goods retailers are not stopping. With an expected </span><a href="https://www.marketwatch.com/press-release/global-sporting-goods-market-2019-industry-trends-future-growth-regional-overview-market-share-size-revenue-and-forecast-outlook-till-2025-2019-06-11" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span style="font-weight: 400;">growth at 4.0%</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> between 2019 and 2025, the </span><a href="https://www.marketwatch.com/press-release/global-sporting-goods-market-2019-industry-trends-future-growth-regional-overview-market-share-size-revenue-and-forecast-outlook-till-2025-2019-06-11" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span style="font-weight: 400;">rise in the number of health-conscious consumers</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> has helped push the growth of the industry like never before. However, health isn’t the only thing shifting in this industry, sportswear brands are now moving towards more</span><a href="https://www.retaildive.com/news/the-state-of-sports-retail-how-athleisure-keeps-changing-the-game/518126/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span style="font-weight: 400;"> lifestyle-focused labels</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> and styles, changing the identity of the industry altogether.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">By expanding their offering with things like athleisure gear, additional services and repairs, our sporting goods retailers have stayed competitive in a changing market. These retailers worked hard to understand industry trends and keep their customers top of mind. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Customer-centric tools like loyalty programs are the gateway for improved customer satisfaction and sales. For Nicole, “the core of any retail business is inventory management, CRM and loyalty, and those are essential factors that any retailer needs to have in order to be profitable in the long term.”</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2><b>Out with the old, in with the cloud-based point of sale </b></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">One thing that our customers have in common? They’re all using technology to their advantage to improve their business.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As the retail industry moves to bridge the gap between e-commerce and brick-and-mortar and begins transitioning out of old school systems, retailers are looking for solutions that can accommodate a range of needs. It’s not just about calculating transactions—retailers are looking for tools that will help them tackle a myriad of tasks from inventory management and reporting to customer relationship management. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Traditional points of sale simply won’t do. According to Nicole, “savvy merchants are now able to apply more clarity to their business. Old fashioned systems simply don’t offer that.” Having technology like a </span><a href="/pos/retail/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span style="font-weight: 400;">cloud-based point of sale</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> that can help your business reach its potential is key in succeeding, even when the industry is stagnant. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As Nicole puts it, “with Lightspeed POS&#8230; you have a trusted partner to help bring you the clarity you need to understand your collective business operations.” </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">And we couldn’t agree more. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Congratulations to all the big retail winners this 2019, and on to an even better 2020. </span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Kick-off 2020 on the right foot by taking a look at how your retail business fared last year. Running these seven <strong>Lightspeed Retail and Analytics reports</strong> annually will give you actionable data you can use to make the right decisions when it comes to inventory, sales and labor. </span></p>
<ol>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2 id="section1"><b>1. Sales over time report</b></h2>
<p><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Report available in </span></i><a href="/pos/retail/"><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Lightspeed Retail</span></i></a></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The sales over time report is a straightforward way to see how your business performed throughout the year. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">If you have multiple stores, running this report by store </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">and </span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">by overall business performance is crucial. If you only view your data as a whole, you may find one of your locations had a particularly good month that masks weak performance in another location. If you only view your data by store, you may miss how well you’re doing overall and miss opportunities to grow.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Once you have your data, you can start making decisions for replicating your successes and addressing any low points. </span>If you had strong sales<span style="font-weight: 400;"> in the summer months, whatever promotions and deals you were running clearly resonated well with your customers—can you replicate that success again this year? If you identify any weeks and months that had </span>unusual slumps<span style="font-weight: 400;">, can you apply your promotional tactics from your better months to those periods in the future?</span></p>
<h4><b>How to run this report:</b></h4>
<ol>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Open Lightspeed Retail and navigate to </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Reports</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Start a new</span> <b><i>Sales over time</i></b> <span style="font-weight: 400;">report. Set the date range from January 1st to December 31st of the previous year.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Specify if you want the data to be grouped by day, week or month in the dropdown menu. We recommend reviewing this data by week or month.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">For multi-store accounts: under the </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Shop</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> dropdown menu, select the store you’d like to run the report for, or select </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">All shops</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> to see aggregated data.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Hit </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Search</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> to run the report. </span></li>
</ol>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2 id="section2"><b>2. Sales year over year report</b></h2>
<p><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Report available in </span></i><a href="/pos/retail/analytics/"><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Lightspeed Analytics</span></i></a></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">If you’ve integrated Lightspeed’s </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">advanced retail analytics</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> into your POS, you may want to consult this report instead of a sales over time report (mentioned above). It will give you the same underlying data, but it digs deeper.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As you run this report, be sure to evaluate your performance both overall and by individual store. In addition, run the report through different variations, such as by brand or by category—this data will help you make informed decisions to better stock your stores in the future. It may be time to say goodbye to a vendor if their products trended negatively last year, or it may be time to start stocking more products from a particular brand that sold well. </span></p>
<h3><b>How to run this report:</b></h3>
<ol>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Open Lightspeed Analytics and navigate to </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Sales and Inventory</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> &gt; </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Reports</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">. </span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Start a new </span><b><i>Sales year over year</i></b> <span style="font-weight: 400;">report by clicking the </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Options</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> button. Select the report variant you wish to view, i.e. default, by vendor, by category.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">For multi-store accounts: under </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Dimensions</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> &gt; </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Multi-Shop</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">, find the </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Store</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> dimension. Add it to the report as a pivot and hit </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Run</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></li>
</ol>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2 id="section3"><b>3. Profit year over year report</b></h2>
<p><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Report available in Lightspeed Analytics</span></i></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Your sales are your overall totals—reports on your sales will tell you how much revenue you made without any caveats or qualifications—and your profits are what you take home at the end of the day. <a href="https://smallbusiness.chron.com/sales-revenue-vs-profit-23058.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Making that distinction crystal clear </a></span><span style="font-weight: 400;">is crucial, so be sure to run this report alongside your sales report.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A report on your profits will take factors like expenses (salaries, purchases), fees or overhead (rent, bills) and taxes into account. If your sales trended upwards last year, but your profits didn’t follow the same trend, you know you need to do some digging into your expenses and costs going forward.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Be sure to run this report with variations to get the full picture. You may want to adjust your purchasing plans based on the true profits a brand may be bringing in. If sales for a brand or category are low, but the relative profit percentage on those sales is very high, you could consider promoting the products to broaden their potential reach. </span></p>

<h2 id="section4"><b>4. Units per sale report</b></h2>
<p><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Report available in Lightspeed Retail</span></i><br />
<span style="font-weight: 400;">Running the units per sale report will give you some insight as to why your profit may have increased or decreased; historical data will come in handy here. If your employees were successfully upselling last year, your units per sale will trend upwards. If your units per sale didn’t significantly increase, but your profits did, your customers were likely more drawn to higher-value items than in previous years.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Essentially, having this information helps you make the right decisions for growth in the upcoming year. If you’re operating multiple stores, run the report for each shop individually because what is true in one shop may not be the case in another.</span></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2 id="section1"><b>What is a payment gateway?</b></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A payment gateway is a technology that a merchant uses to accept debit or credit card purchases from its customers. Payment gateways include the physical card-reading devices and payment terminals found in-store as well as the payment processing portals used for online transactions. Brick-and-mortar payment gateways have also started accepting payments through digital payment distribution services like Apple Pay, GooglePay and Samsung Pay thanks to </span><a href="https://www.techradar.com/news/what-is-nfc" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span style="font-weight: 400;">near field communication (NFC) technology. </span></a></p>
<h3><b>Payment gateways vs. payment providers</b></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A </span><b>payment processor</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> (like PayPal) facilitates a transaction, whereas a </span><b>payment gateway</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> (like Payflow) either approves or declines transactions between a merchant and their customers. </span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2 id="section2"><b>How does a payment gateway work?</b></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A payment gateway helps authorize and process transactions between retail merchants and their customers, online and in-store. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Payment gateways encrypt sensitive information (like the credit card number) related to payment. It guarantees that the information is transferred securely between the customer and the merchant. Here’s a breakdown of how payment gateways work:</span></p>
<ul>
<li><b>Step 1:</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> A customer either places an order online or completes a transaction at a merchant’s physical store. </span></li>
<li><b>Step 2: </b><span style="font-weight: 400;">The payment gateway then securely transfers the transaction information to the acquiring bank (either the merchant bank or the acquirer). </span></li>
<li><b>Step 3: </b><span style="font-weight: 400;">The payment gateway determines which credit card provider (Visa, Mastercard, American Express, etc) issued the buyer’s card. </span></li>
<li><b>Step 4:</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> The payment gateway routes transaction information (credit card and banking information, the transaction amount, etc) to the correct payment switch. </span></li>
<li><b>Step 5: </b><span style="font-weight: 400;">The payment switch then sends the transaction request to the issuing bank and sends the transaction information to the credit card’s network. </span></li>
<li><b>Step 6:</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> The issuing bank runs the transaction through its fraud detection procedure to see whether or not the transaction is legitimate. They also confirm whether or not the buyer has enough available credit to make the purchase. </span></li>
<li><b>Step 7: </b><span style="font-weight: 400;">The issuing bank either approves or declines the transaction, and sends that information back through the credit card network to the merchant bank and payment gateway. </span></li>
</ul>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2 id="section3"><b>Payment gateway security standards</b></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">There are several security standards that payment gateways must adhere to, most notably around data encryption and PCI compliance.</span></p>
<h3><b>Data encryption</b></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Payment gateways encrypt data using a </span><a href="https://blog.hubspot.com/marketing/what-is-ssl" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span style="font-weight: 400;">secure sockets layer (SSL)</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> to protect the buyer’s sensitive banking information prior to sending the transaction through the credit card’s network. This encryption assures that the buyer’s credit card information is coded, making it difficult for malicious agents, fraudsters and hackers to access it while it’s transferred between different agents throughout the payment process. </span></p>
<h3><b>PCI compliance</b></h3>
<p><a href="/blog/what-is-pci-compliance/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span style="font-weight: 400;">PCI compliance</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> is a set of security standards created by the Payment Card Industry Data Security Standard (PCI DSS) to ensure that all companies that accept, process, store or transmit credit card information maintain a secure environment to protect both the consumer and the merchant. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In many cases, retail merchants build their payment processing systems using solutions from several different companies. They may use one company’s payment terminals, payment gateways from another and a </span><strong><a href="/pos/retail/">point of sale system</a></strong><span style="font-weight: 400;"> yet another. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">While each of those three solutions may individually be PCI compliant, that doesn’t guarantee that, when all three are used in tandem, the merchant is PCI compliant. That’s because PCI compliance also includes how merchants connect all of their payment processing systems together and how they manage their customers’ data. </span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2 id="section4"><b>How to pick a payment gateway provider</b></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">When you use different providers for payment processing, payment gateways and ringing up sales, there’s more room for bad actors to take advantage of potential vulnerabilities.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Lightspeed helps retailers avoid this problem by providing retailers with a point of sale system, eCommerce platform and </span><a href="/pos/retail/payments/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">end-to-end payment processing</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, effectively eliminating the third-parties. We capture your customer’s payment information at the point of sale (no manual reconciling necessary) and work directly with credit card payment gateways to safely and securely deposit those payments into your bank account. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Rather than need to do your due diligence to see whether or not your third-party payment provider and payment gateway integrates with your retail point of sale system and online store, Lightspeed’s PCI-compliant </span><a href="/blog/payment-processing-integrated-vs-non-integrated/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span style="font-weight: 400;">integrated payment processing</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> does it all the heavy lifting for you. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Additionally, traditional third-party payment processors require retail merchants to open up their own merchant account (a unique bank account that may come with a lot of paperwork and associated fees), but with Lightspeed, Lightspeed becomes the merchant of record. We take full responsibility for maintaining a merchant account so you don’t have to. What that means is that all card payments are sent first to our shared merchant account, then safely forwarded to your business bank account. </span></p>

Visit our </span><a href="https://retail-support.lightspeedhq.com/hc/en-us/articles/229130928-Configuring-your-payment-processing" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span style="font-weight: 400;">support page</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> dedicated to the topic for more details. </span></div>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2><b>Scale your business with integrated payments</b></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Before you sign up with a third-party payment processing or gateway provider, do your homework. Find out if there are any hidden fees and make sure how their solution fits in with your retail point of sale system. For example, if you’re using an online payment gateway for your online store and a physical payment gateway for your physical store, you want both third-party systems to send transaction data to your point of sale system to simplify your bookkeeping. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Whether you’re growing your retail business, opening a new location or just exploring credit card payments for the first time, you’ll benefit from having a crystal clear understanding of the different combinations of payment processors, merchant accounts, point of sale systems and payment gateway providers </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">before</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> you sign on the dotted line. </span></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2 id="section1"><b>What is a barcode?</b></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A barcode is an image that consists of a series of parallel black and white bars that can be read by a barcode scanner. Barcodes are applied to products to quickly identify them. Among their many uses, barcodes are typically used in retail stores as a part of the purchasing process, in warehouses to track and manage inventory and on invoices to help with accounting. </span></p>
<h3><b>What is a barcode scanner? </b></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A barcode scanner (also referred to as a barcode reader) is a device that captures and decodes the information contained by a barcode. Traditional barcode scanners consist of the following four components: </span></p>
<ol>
<li><b>Light source: </b>This helps the barcode read and accurately decode the information contained in a barcode.</li>
<li><strong>Lens:</strong><span style="font-weight: 400;"> This scans the barcode. </span></li>
<li><strong>Photoconductor:</strong> <span style="font-weight: 400;">This translates optical impulses into electrical ones. </span></li>
<li><strong>Decoder:</strong> <span style="font-weight: 400;">This analyzes the barcode’s data and sends it to the scanner’s output port. </span></li>
</ol>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">After capturing the information, barcode scanners link to a host computer or tablet and transmit that information in real-time, without additional human intervention. This helps retailers automate data collection processes and reduce human errors like inventory tracking and processing point of sale transactions. </span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2 id="section2"><b>How do barcodes work?</b></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In a nutshell, a barcode is a way to encode information into a visual pattern (those black lines and white spaces) that a machine (a barcode scanner) can read. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The combination of black and white bars (also referred to as elements) represents varying text characters that follow a pre-established algorithm for that barcode (more on the types of barcodes later). A barcode scanner will read this pattern of black and white bars and translate them into a line of test that your <strong><a href="/pos/retail/">retail point of sale system</a></strong> can understand. </span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2 id="section3"><b>Types of barcodes</b></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">There are two types of barcodes: 1-dimensional (1D) and 2-dimensional (2D). </span></p>
<h3><b>1-dimensional (1D) barcodes</b></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">1D barcodes are a series of black and white bars that can store information like a product’s type, size and color. You can find 1D barcodes on the top of universal product codes (UPCs) of a product’s packaging. This helps track packages through package delivery service providers like UPS and FedEx, the US Postal Service and Canada Post.  </span></p>
<h3><b>2-dimensional (2D) barcodes</b></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">2D barcodes are more complex than 1D barcodes. They can include more information than just text, like price, inventory levels and even a product image. There are plenty of barcode scanners that support 2D barcodes. While not all barcode scanners can read 2D barcodes, Lightspeed Retail POS is compatible with several wireless </span><a href="https://retail-support.lightspeedhq.com/hc/en-us/articles/229131008-Supported-hardware" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span style="font-weight: 400;">barcode scanners</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> that support 2D barcodes. </span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2 id="section4"><b>The benefits of using barcodes</b></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">While barcodes were originally developed to speed up the sales and transaction process, they come with several other benefits.</span></p>
<h3><b>Improved accuracy</b></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Using a barcode to process a product’s data is much more accurate than having a sales associate manually enter that data, which is prone to human error.  </span></p>
<h3><b>Real-time data</b></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Because of the speed at which the information is processed, data about inventory levels or sales is available immediately. </span></p>
<h3><b>Reduced training requirements</b></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Thanks to a barcode scanner’s ease of use (just point and click), employees don’t need much training on how to use one. </span></p>
<h3><b>Better inventory management</b></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">With improved accuracy and real-time data, retailers benefit from faster </span><a href="/blog/cycle-counting/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span style="font-weight: 400;">cycle counts</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> and more accurate inventory turnover estimations. </span></p>
<h3><b>Low cost of implementation</b></h3>
<p><a href="/resources/retail/barcode-generator/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Generating barcodes</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> is quick and simple, plus, the potential savings thanks to improved transaction speed, as well as the improved accuracy of inventory and sales data, retailers can anticipate savings post-implementation.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2 id="section5"><b>What is a universal product code (UPC)?</b></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A universal product code (UPC) is a code that’s printed on a retail product’s packaging to help it be identified. There are two parts that make up a UPC: the machine-readable barcode (which is a series of black bars) and the unique 12-digit number located beneath the barcode. </span></p>
<h3><b>Parts of a UPC</b></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">To get a UPC to use on products, a company needs to apply through </span><a href="https://www.gs1us.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span style="font-weight: 400;">GS1 US</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> (the Global Standards Organization), which manages and assigns UPCs in the US. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">After paying the application fee, GS1 assigns a six-digit manufacturer </span><b>identification number</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">; that becomes the first six digits of the UPC for all of the company’s products and identifies the item’s manufacturer. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The subsequent five digits of the UPC are the </span><b>item number</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">, which identifies the product itself. Each company should have a person responsible for issuing item numbers, ensuring that the same number isn’t used more than once and that numbers associated with discontinued products are no longer used. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Most consumer products have several variations based on their size, color, etc. Each variation needs its own item number. For example, a box of medium-sized t-shirts will have a different item number than a box of the same t-shirt in size small.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The last digit of a 12-digit UPC is the </span><b>check digit</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">. It’s found by adding and multiplying several of the UPC code’s numbers to confirm to the barcode scanner that the UPC is a valid one. If the check digit code isn’t correct, the result is that the UPC code won’t scan properly. </span></p>
<p><img class="size-full wp-image-28267 aligncenter" src="https://blog-assets.lightspeedhq.com/img/2020/01/acba6d3e-parts-of-a-upc-code.jpg" alt="Graph that shows the different parts of a UPC code" width="718" height="436" data-wp-editing="1" srcset="https://blog-assets.lightspeedhq.com/img/2020/01/acba6d3e-parts-of-a-upc-code.jpg 718w, https://blog-assets.lightspeedhq.com/img/2020/01/acba6d3e-parts-of-a-upc-code-300x182.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 718px) 100vw, 718px" /></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2 id="section6"><b>What&#8217;s the purpose of a UPC?</b></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">UPCs make it easy to identify a product by its name, item type, size and color when it’s scanned at the checkout. They were initially created to make grocery store checkouts faster, but nowadays they’re also commonly used to help track inventory in retail stores and warehouses. </span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2 id="section7"><b>The advantages of a UPC</b></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">There are several advantages, both for businesses and consumers, for using UPCs. Since UPCs help barcode scanners identify a product and its cost, UPCs help improve checkout speed. They effectively remove the need to manually input a product’s information. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">UPCs also improve inventory tracking and management. They help merchants know when they need to stock more of a particular product either on their shelves or in stock more in their warehouse. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">If ever there’s an issue with a product, UPCs also help merchants find the customers that purchased that product, contact them and issue a recall. </span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2 id="section8"><b>UPCs vs. SKUs</b></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Let’s talk about the difference between a UPC and a stock keeping unit (SKU). While they share some similarities, they aren’t the same thing. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A UPC is a universal product code; it’s meant to identify a product regardless of where it was sold. For example, if you buy a t-shirt online or through a local retailer that also sells the same product, that t-shirt will have the same UPC. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A SKU, however, is an internal product inventory code that’s unique from one company to the other. If you were to compare the SKU of the same product at two different stores, you’d see that they were different. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">If you’re confused as to whether you’re looking at a UPC or SKU, the UPC symbol is the barcode label or bar coding on the back of a product, whereas the SKU is typically found on a store’s unique shelf pricing. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">If you were to try looking up a product online, using the product’s UPC will help you find it across numerous retailers, whereas the SKU would only find the product under the business using that specific SKU. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">UPCs can be valuable for suppliers and manufacturers to track the inventory they sell to different retail merchants, whereas SKUs are valuable for merchants to track and manage their inventory in a way that’s unique to their business. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Both SKUs and UPCs are advantageous for retailers: SKUs for their customizability and UPCs for their universality. Many businesses use a mix of UPCs and SKUs.

<h2><b>Winner: Local Hero Award &#8211; </b><a href="https://www.loyalteeboutique.com/"><b>Loyal Tee Boutique</b></a></h2>
<div style="border-left-style: solid; border-left-color: #ed5153; border-left-width: 4px; padding-bottom: 5px;">
<div style="margin-left: 20px; font-size: 1.125rem; line-height: 1.45;"><em>The Local Hero Award is given to a Lightspeed retailer that cements themselves as a backbone of their local community.</em></div>
</div>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Tori Erickson’s entrepreneurial journey started small. The Loyal Tee founder began by selling hand-picked apparel at open house nights. Before long, word spread and they became a gathering space for the community.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">That’s when Tori had a lightbulb moment and realized she had an opportunity to help a community that was hit hard by globalization and overseas manufacturing. “My whole purpose with opening Loyal Tee was to give back to the community and add something fun in the area,” says Tori. </span></p>
<style>.embed-container { position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.25%; height: 0; overflow: hidden; max-width: 100%; } .embed-container iframe, .embed-container object, .embed-container embed { position: absolute; top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; }</style>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In her hometown of Clio, Michigan, over 20% of the population lives below the poverty line. Tori wanted Loyal Tee to be more than just another boutique; she wanted to uplift everyone who walked through its doors and create a community that brought residents closer to one another. “When a customer walks in the door, we treat them like friends. My goal isn’t to just sell things. I want people to leave with a smile on their face because of how awesome they’re treated.” </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Tori’s vision has succeeded in bringing the community together, but she’s not done yet. With aspirations of moving into a bigger commercial space and expanding her product offering for kids and men’s items, she’s only getting started. </span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">They’re a bartender’s trusty sidekick, but what does that mean exactly? What does a barback do each and every shift?  </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In this post, we’ll explore what a barback is, what their tasks are, what skills a barback needs to be successful and tips for hiring a great barback.</span></p>

</ul>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Let’s dive in! </span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2 id="section1"><b>What is a barback?</b></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A barback is a bar’s equivalent to a busser. Their role is to ensure that the bartender has everything they need during service to keep everything running smoothly: clean glasses, enough garnishes, liquor, beer and spirits, ice cubes, etc. Similarly to bussers, they’re also responsible for keeping the service area tidy (cleaning up spills and broken glasses) and running to the walk-in to restock whatever’s running low. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">And for many, being a barback is the first step to </span><a href="/blog/how-to-become-a-bartender/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span style="font-weight: 400;">becoming a bartender.</span></a></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">For Stephanie Jones, former restaurant manager, bartender and server, as well as founder of the blog </span><a href="http://twogirlsonesuitcase.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Two Girls One Suitcase</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, a barback’s job is to make a bartender&#8217;s life easier, keep service running smoothly and “make the guest experience more pleasurable.” Whether that’s acknowledging a guest who&#8217;s waiting to grab the bartender’s attention or fixing issues behind the scenes, they’re a catch-all, problem-solver extraordinaire. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Most bartenders work as a barback before moving up the ladder. It’s a great position for learning the ins and outs of bartending and customer service before being put in a customer-facing role. </span></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2 id="section2"><b>What are a barback’s duties and responsibilities? </b></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A barback handles a long and varied list of tasks on any given day. While a barback’s duties and responsibilities vary in each establishment, there are a few common tasks any barback will likely encounter during any given shift. Here are 22 typical tasks that a barback is expected to take ownership for: </span></p>

</ul>

</ul>
<h3><b>Miscellaneous tasks </b></h3>
<ul>
<li>Helping the bartender with ad-hoc requests throughout service</li>
<li><span style="font-weight: 400;">Communicating with security when a customer is drinking from a personal bottle, getting exceptionally rowdy, acting inappropriately or when they suspect someone is underage</span></li>
<li><span style="font-weight: 400;">Placing incoming orders through the point of sale system or notifying the bartender of new orders they see on the </span><a href="/pos/restaurant/kitchen-display-system/" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Kitchen Display System (KDS) </span></a></li>
</ul>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Suzannah Gerber, food and beverage industry consultant and owner of </span><a href="https://www.linkedin.com/company/havenveganconsulting/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Haven Foods</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, adds that barbacks are a crucial part of a high-volume team, and they absolutely possess different skills than other service members.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Barbacks need to keep an on inventory levels at all times during service and be aware of the movement and flow of orders and flight path of the bartender,” she says. “They also need to be strong enough to carry heavy items like kegs and be able to repair clogged taps or ice machines at a moment’s notice. A jack-of-all-trades barback can make huge differences in a bar’s service and flow”. </span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2 id="section3"><b>How much do barbacks make? </b></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A barback is typically seen as an entry-level position that aspiring bartenders take on. As such, they’re usually paid tipped minimum wage. Depending on your establishment’s </span><a href="/blog/restaurant-tip-out-structure/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span style="font-weight: 400;">tip out structure</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, the type of clientele it attracts and how its drinks are priced, that can be anywhere between </span><a href="https://barsandbartending.com/barbacks/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span style="font-weight: 400;">1-2% of sales or 5-20% of total tips. </span></a></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2 id="section4"><b>How to write a great barback job description</b></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Each establishment has different needs, which means their job description should reflect the duties and responsibilities they want their barback to take care of. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A </span><a href="/blog/restaurant-management/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span style="font-weight: 400;">successful bar or restaurant manager</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> should be able to assess what skills each of their employees needs to possess and communicate that information in each job description, but it’s important to note that tasks shouldn’t be limited to what’s written in that job description. Barbacks need to be able to adapt and help wherever it&#8217;s needed. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Here’s a list of 11 hard and soft skills we recommend that your barback should have: </span></p>
<h3><b>Hard skills for barbacks </b></h3>
<ol>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><b>Basic kitchen skills: </b><span style="font-weight: 400;">Barbacks need to be able to prepare garnishes and help out in the kitchen if needed. </span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><b>Heavy lifting:</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Putting away shipments of liquor and beer and carrying kegs requires some strength. Make sure your barback is capable of doing some heavy lifting. </span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><b>Bar and drinks knowledge:</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Barbacks are going to learn a lot of this on-the-job from the bartender, but it’s important that they possess a basic knowledge of liquors, spirits, beers, wines and flavor profiles.</span></li>
</ol>
<h3><b>Soft skills for barbacks </b></h3>
<ol>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><b>Organization:</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> How can you expect a barback to help your bartender run a tight ship if they aren’t organized? To be successful, a barback needs to be organized and systematic, while being adaptable enough to anticipate any obstacles that get thrown their way during each and every shift. </span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><b>Proactive:</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> A great barback needs to see into the future and take care of tasks before they become urgent. That means restocking bottles, garnishes, etc, before the bartender has to ask.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><b>Problem-solving:</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> The people are what makes customer service enjoyable and challenging. If a customer is being difficult, your barback needs to be able to keep their cool and solve their problems with a smile.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><b>Customer service: </b><span style="font-weight: 400;">Your barback is inevitably going to need to talk with customers. Make sure they have strong interpersonal skills, are friendly, outgoing and helpful by nature. </span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><b>Multitasking: </b><span style="font-weight: 400;">A successful barback will try to maximize the tasks they take care of in the time they have. For example, if they’re heading to the kitchen, bringing dirty dishes with them to the dish pit at the same time. </span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><b>Working under pressure:</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> The service industry is fast-paced. A barback needs to be able to handle the pressure of a packed Saturday night without burning out. </span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><b>Prioritization:</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Issues are bound to come up simultaneously. The toilet is clogged and napkins need to be refilled. Which task do they take care of first? Barbacks need to be able to quickly triage tasks and handle them accordingly. </span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><b>Adaptability: </b><span style="font-weight: 400;">Christopher Manning, Managing Director or </span><a href="https://gastronomerlifestyle.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Gastronomer Lifestyle Ltd.</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, says that the ability to adapt is what separates good barbacks from great ones. “When a bar gets hit by the evening rush they must be able to assess and prioritize the tasks at hand. It’s always important to finish each task you start too; don’t leave it for someone else.” </span></li>
</ol>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">For many, being a barback is just a stepping stone to becoming a bartender full-time. In your job description, clearly outline whether or not there’s an opportunity for career growth and how long it may take for them to take that next step. In most establishments, it takes anywhere between 12 to 16 months before they transition from barback to bartender. </span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2 id="section5"><b>How to hire a barback</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> </span></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Once you’ve written an accurate, </span><a href="/blog/temporary-restaurant-staffing/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span style="font-weight: 400;">descriptive job ad,</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> you need to post your job ad on the right channels for it to be seen by qualified candidates. We suggest starting with these websites: </span></p>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><a href="https://www.monster.com/?disGeo=true" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Monster</span></a></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><a href="https://www.simplyhired.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Simply Hired</span></a></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><a href="https://ca.indeed.com/?r=us" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Indeed</span></a></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><a href="https://www.craigslist.org/about/sites" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Craigslist</span></a></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><a href="https://staffy.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Staffy</span></a></li>
</ul>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Along with those job listing websites, post on your Facebook and Instagram accounts that you’re hiring. The people who follow your establishment on social media are your biggest fans. Who knows? Maybe one of them is your next barback, too. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Additionally, let your staff know that you’re looking for a barback. Great people know other great people; leverage your employee’s network of friends to find candidates that have a great chance of being a strong cultural fit. If they need some incentive, consider giving them a referral bonus if the candidate they recommend is hired, performs well in their role and successfully completes their probation period. </span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2 id="section6"><b>Barback training tips  </b></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Once you’ve hired your ideal candidate to be a barback, you need to invest in training them so they can reach their maximum potential. The good news is that training a barback is similar to training any restaurant employee: you need a solid mix of on-the-job learning, formal training and on-the-spot feedback. </span></p>

<h3><b>Onboarding</b></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">First thing’s first, you need to be crystal clear with your new hire about things like your dress code, what is and isn’t acceptable behavior, how to use your POS system and the type of service you expect them to give customers. An </span><a href="/blog/restaurant-employee-handbook/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span style="font-weight: 400;">employee handbook</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> makes it much easier to get new hires up to speed on the essentials of working at your establishment (like procedures, policies and guidelines.)</span></p>
<h3><b>Shadowing</b></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Nothing can replace learning from someone who has been there and done that. Before giving your barback full autonomy, have them do a walkthrough of their tasks, how and when to do them pre, during and post-service with one of your senior barbacks or your bartender. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">When they learn the ropes and have the safety net of experienced supervision, they’re less likely to make mistakes when they’re on their own and can build their confidence quicker. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Plus, shadowing is great for team building. It gives your new hire an opportunity to bond with co-workers, learn their names, what they do and how they fit into your existing team dynamic. They can also get a crash course on what certain </span><a href="/blog/restaurant-terms/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span style="font-weight: 400;">restaurant terms</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> mean, like </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">running</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> a cocktail to table five.</span></p>
<h3><b>Menu education</b></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Learning what’s on your cocktail menu, how each drink is made, what their flavor profiles are and what dishes they complement is vital. While your barback is usually working behind the scenes, if a customer catches their eye and asks them a question on the menu, they need to be able to handle it with confidence. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Have your bartender give the barback a crash course on the </span><a href="/blog/the-ultimate-guide-to-menu-design/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span style="font-weight: 400;">cocktail menu</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> so that they learn the basics and feel encouraged to ask questions. The more information your bartender passes on to the barback, the more useful their trusty sidekick will be. </span></p>
<h3><b>Environment</b></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Give your new hires a tour of your establishment. Show them where the cleaning products are stored, where clean and dirty utensils go, where the liquor cellar is and where the dish pit is—you get the idea. Show them where all the things they may need during a shift are located so that they can be more proactive once service starts. </span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2 id="section7"><b>How to know when your barback is ready to become a bartender</b></h2>
<p><img class="aligncenter wp-image-28185" src="https://blog-assets.lightspeedhq.com/img/2020/01/c41df58e-pamplemousse_0176_edit-scaled.jpg" alt="Image of bartender serving a drink in a bar" width="800" height="533" srcset="https://blog-assets.lightspeedhq.com/img/2020/01/c41df58e-pamplemousse_0176_edit-scaled.jpg 2560w, https://blog-assets.lightspeedhq.com/img/2020/01/c41df58e-pamplemousse_0176_edit-300x200.jpg 300w, https://blog-assets.lightspeedhq.com/img/2020/01/c41df58e-pamplemousse_0176_edit-1024x683.jpg 1024w, https://blog-assets.lightspeedhq.com/img/2020/01/c41df58e-pamplemousse_0176_edit-768x512.jpg 768w, https://blog-assets.lightspeedhq.com/img/2020/01/c41df58e-pamplemousse_0176_edit-1536x1024.jpg 1536w, https://blog-assets.lightspeedhq.com/img/2020/01/c41df58e-pamplemousse_0176_edit-2048x1365.jpg 2048w, https://blog-assets.lightspeedhq.com/img/2020/01/c41df58e-pamplemousse_0176_edit-1568x1045.jpg 1568w" sizes="(max-width: 800px) 100vw, 800px" /></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">While there’s no exact timeline for a barback to become a bartender, in most establishments it can take between 12 to 16 months. That’s enough time to learn the ropes from your bartender, get comfortable with the cocktail menu and your clientele. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Even once you think they’re ready to take the next step (and they’ve shown interest in becoming a bartender) you should plan a transition period where the barback shadows the lead bartender more intently and starts serving customers during slower shifts where they’re less likely to get overwhelmed. This also gives you time to hire a new barback to take their place. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Even if the legal drinking age in the US is 21, bartenders </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">can</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> be under the legal drinking age depending on the </span><a href="https://blogs.findlaw.com/free_enterprise/2014/02/is-it-legal-to-serve-alcohol-if-youre-under-21.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span style="font-weight: 400;">state’s on-premise alcohol serving laws.</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> While some states allow underagers to serve alcohol, others require that they be 21 and over, have a manager or supervisor over 21 present or that an underage bartender or barback complete beverage service training. Bottom line: make sure your barback has the </span><a href="/blog/how-to-get-a-liquor-license/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span style="font-weight: 400;">necessary licenses</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> and permits and meets your state’s alcohol service laws before making it official.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2><b>Finding the barback that’s right for you</b></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Knowing what to look out for is key in finding a barback, but even more important is finding a barback that works well with your team. Working in the restaurant and bar industry means busy and hectic nights, working in close quarters, in a potentially high tension environment. Fostering good chemistry with your team can be the difference between success and failure with your new hire. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A barback can tick all the boxes, but if the chemistry isn’t there with the team, this will affect your service and eventually your customer experience. According to Jones, attitude and work ethic is key to being a great barback. “Your barback has to possess a can-do attitude and always be ready to support your bartender and other staff in any way they can.” </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">So during your search, prioritize the unteachable intangibles: work ethic and attitude. Ideally, you want someone who has both of those and possesses the hard and soft skills we mentioned earlier, but while you can teach skills, you can’t teach attitude. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Good luck in your search!</span></p>

<h2 id="section1"><b>The 3 common pitfalls of retail accounting software</b></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Retailers have more than a few accounting tasks that they need to manage on a daily, weekly, monthly and annual basis. If they’re not done well, things can get messy in a hurry. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">When you’re looking for retail accounting software, make sure that the option you choose can manage each of the following things effectively: </span></p>
<h3><b>1. Inventory</b></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Inventory is one of the, if not the, largest active asset that retailers have. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Smart inventory management goes beyond just ordering and selling products. Accounting software needs to tell you your cost of goods sold (COGS), each item’s profitability, how long inventory sits on your shelves, inventory turnover and shrinkage. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">We suggest making sure that your accounting software syncs directly with your point of sale system to assure that your inventory management capabilities are as robust as you need. Lightspeed’s industry-leading </span><a href="https://www.lightspeedhq.com/pos/retail/inventory-management-software/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">inventory management software</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> can sync with your favorite accounting software to give you the best of both worlds. </span></p>
<h3><b>2. Sales tax</b></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Although there are exceptions to the rule (such as Alberta, Canada) most provinces and states have a sales tax. Due to the proliferation of eCommerce, many states and provinces are passing laws that require out-of-state retailers to both collect and remit sales tax. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Accounting software should track sales taxes due. Failure to collect and remit sales tax can result in hefty fines and—in some cases—result in your business closing. Some accounting solutions can reliably automate this for your business. </span></p>
<h3><b>3. Payroll</b></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Payroll, after inventory and rent, is the largest expense a retailer has. Assure that your accounting software can handle payroll accurately, efficiently and effectively. </span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2><b>Which retail accounting software is right for you? </b></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Whether you choose to use an accounting solution like Quickbooks or you decide to integrate your accounting software with your point of sale system using options like Lightspeed Accounting, what’s important is that your data is accurate, updates automatically and that you have access to training and support required to use the software properly.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">While it may feel tempting to get the cheapest software you can find, accurate accounting, inventory management, tax compliance and payroll is not something you want to shortchange. Make sure you&#8217;re using the right accounting, </span><a href="https://www.lightspeedhq.com/pos/retail/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">point of sale</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, analytics and reporting systems to put your retail business in the best position to be as profitable as possible. </span></p>

It requires financial resources, business savvy, the right people, an appetizing menu, and some magic. Even after all of those components fall into place and you’re ready to open your doors, things might not work out exactly as planned. </span></p>
<p><b>Soft openings</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> are a smart idea for restaurants because restaurants are a constant work in progress. A soft launch lets you test out the waters in a low-pressure environment before officially announcing that your restaurant is open for business. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In this post, we’re going to walk you through how to get value from a restaurant soft opening and position your establishment for success.</span></p>

<h2 id="section1"><b>What is a restaurant soft opening?</b></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A soft opening is an unofficial launch that lets you try out your products and services on customers, incorporate their feedback, and make improvements, all before officially opening your doors and unveiling the finished products. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Your soft-launch could range anywhere from a quiet trial run period leading up to your restaurant’s </span><a href="/blog/restaurant-grand-openings/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span style="font-weight: 400;">grand opening</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, to an invite-only event with members of the media. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">By calling this span of time a soft opening, you’re conveying to customers that you’re still working out the kinks in your business. Customers will be more forgiving of mistakes and slower service times. Use this time to improve on these mistakes and you’ll keep customers coming back after your official opening. Soft openings present a unique opportunity to test out the waters at your new restaurant without the pressure of perfection. </span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2 id="section2"><b>Why are soft openings useful?</b></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A soft opening serves as a trial run before you officially open your doors to business and lets you create a buzz, predict demand, create future revenue, perfect the menu, and work out the kinks in your service. It’s like a rehearsal for your restaurant’s </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">grand opening</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> and daily operations. Here’s how a soft opening can benefit your new restaurant.</span></p>
<ol>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Create a buzz</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Predict demand</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Create future revenue</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Perfect your menu</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Work out any kinks</span></li>
</ol>
<h3><b>Create a buzz</b></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Having a soft opening can help your restaurant generate attention before it is officially open. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The level of buzz you get will depend on how much attention you draw to your soft opening. If you decide to throw a launch party and </span><a href="https://www.modernrestaurantmanagement.com/diy-pr-attracting-media-coverage-for-your-restaurant/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span style="font-weight: 400;">invite media and influencers</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, you’ll get more buzz (but also more pressure) than if you put up a post on Instagram saying that your doors are open but that you’re still working out the kinks in the business. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Either way, it takes time for new businesses to get noticed, so generating buzz through word of mouth, social media, or traditional media will benefit your restaurant.</span></p>

<h3><b>Predict demand </b></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A soft opening can help you predict demand at your restaurant. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">For example, a soft launch can help you can anticipate what times of day will be the busiest for your restaurant. Perhaps during your weeklong soft opening, you notice that the lunch rush is incredibly popular, but your dinner service is empty. With this insight, you may decide to adjust your hours to cut down on operational costs and dedicate efforts to <a href="/blog/how-to-start-restaurant-catering-business/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">catering and events</a> rather than dinner service. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">You will also find out quickly which menu items are the most in-demand to help you perfect your inventory management to reduce food waste.</span></p>
<h3><b>Create future revenue</b></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A soft launch will give you an opportunity to generate future revenue. When you hand out coupons or get customers to sign up for your loyalty program during the trial run, you’ll entice customers to come back in the future. </span></p>
<p><a href="https://sevenrooms.com/en/blog/why-people-become-restaurant-regulars-and-how-to-keep-them-coming-back/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Regulars</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> are more valuable than one-off customers so implement initiatives that will get your soft launch customers to make your restaurant a part of their routine. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">For example, instead of giving away gift cards at your soft opening, hand out coupons that can be used over an extended period of time. You could give out coupons worth $15 to customers who give you feedback during your soft launch. However, make the coupon valid for $5 each over three visits. By getting customers to come back several times, you’re getting them into the habit of visiting your restaurant on a regular basis. </span></p>
<h3><b>Perfect your menu</b></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Developing a </span><a href="/blog/the-ultimate-guide-to-menu-design/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span style="font-weight: 400;">restaurant menu</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> and recipes, in theory, is one thing. Executing the menu is another thing when you have customers to deal with, new staff to train, and are under a time constraint.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A soft opening is a perfect opportunity to see how long things take to make, which items are the most popular, which items are the least popular and least lucrative, etc. Use this feedback to change your menu before the grand opening. </span></p>
<p><img class="aligncenter wp-image-28044" title="Soft Openings: Why Should Restaurants Have One?" src="https://blog-assets.lightspeedhq.com/img/2020/01/a19600fc-restaurant-soft-openings-scaled.jpg" alt="Restaurant cook preparing a dish during their soft opening" width="1000" height="668" srcset="https://blog-assets.lightspeedhq.com/img/2020/01/a19600fc-restaurant-soft-openings-scaled.jpg 2560w, https://blog-assets.lightspeedhq.com/img/2020/01/a19600fc-restaurant-soft-openings-300x200.jpg 300w, https://blog-assets.lightspeedhq.com/img/2020/01/a19600fc-restaurant-soft-openings-1024x684.jpg 1024w, https://blog-assets.lightspeedhq.com/img/2020/01/a19600fc-restaurant-soft-openings-768x513.jpg 768w, https://blog-assets.lightspeedhq.com/img/2020/01/a19600fc-restaurant-soft-openings-1536x1025.jpg 1536w, https://blog-assets.lightspeedhq.com/img/2020/01/a19600fc-restaurant-soft-openings-2048x1367.jpg 2048w, https://blog-assets.lightspeedhq.com/img/2020/01/a19600fc-restaurant-soft-openings-1568x1047.jpg 1568w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /></p>
<h3><b>Work out any kinks</b></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A soft launch is ideal for testing out what’s working and what isn’t before you draw big crowds. Like a rehearsal for a play, every team will have been working on their own until now. Because the teams are being brought together for the first time ever during the soft opening, they may not do things exactly as planned. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">During the soft opening, you’ll be able to see what things you need to fine-tune before your restaurant grand opening. You can learn valuable things such as:</span></p>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Which employees need more training and in what (customer service, your </span><a href="/pos/restaurant/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span style="font-weight: 400;">restaurant POS</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, etc.)</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">What table configuration works best for your space. You may need to take away or add more tables.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">How customers react to your menu. Gather feedback and consider tweaking the menu for higher customer satisfaction.</span></li>
</ul>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A soft opening can help you learn a lot about your new restaurant before you have to deal with the pressure of crowds and perfection.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

</ol>
<h3><b>1. Plan your menu</b></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Will you make your whole menu available during the soft opening or just a few items? Make sure you have enough inventory to last you through your trial period.</span></p>
<h3><b>2. Choose your pricing strategy</b></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As you plan your menu, it’s important to choose a pricing strategy. Take a look at the cost of goods sold, </span><a href="/blog/how-to-calculate-restaurant-food-costs/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span style="font-weight: 400;">food cost percentage </span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">and average profit margins in order to price food correctly. Use </span><a href="/blog/the-ultimate-guide-to-menu-design/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span style="font-weight: 400;">menu engineering</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> to make higher-margin items more attractive to customers.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Soft opening prices will serve as an anchor for prices after your restaurant grand opening. While customers expect that prices may change after a soft opening, they will be turned off if the final prices stray too far from those during the soft launch. Make smart pricing decisions from the start.</span></p>
<h3><b>3. Prep your staff</b></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Make sure that your staff is ready for the soft opening by training them on recipes, customer service and how to use tech like your restaurant’s POS and payment processing systems.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Keep an eye on staff performance during the soft launch. Ask staff for feedback on how they felt doing certain tasks. Incorporate this feedback into training to make things go smoothly after the official opening. </span></p>

<h3><b>4. Choose a date</b></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Choosing when to have a soft opening can be tricky. We recommend picking a date for your restaurant grand opening first. Pick a date by which you expect you will have worked out all of the kinks in your business.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">We recommend opening your doors discreetly for two to four weeks before the official opening. This </span><a href="https://blog.typsy.com/the-ultimate-opening-day-checklist-for-restaurants" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span style="font-weight: 400;">time frame</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> should give you enough to notice and correct mistakes.</span></p>
<h3><b>5. Build your guest list</b></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">If you plan to throw a not-so-soft opening launch party, choose your guests wisely. If you want to keep it intimate and celebrate with those who have helped your dream become a reality, invite friends, family, and staff.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">If you’re feeling confident in your menu and service and want to generate a bigger buzz, invite influencers, media and local celebrities to your soft opening. </span></p>
<h3><b>6. Send invitations </b></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">If you go down the party route, you have to send out your soft opening invitations. We recommend using digital invitations to cut down on costs and ensure delivery. You can also usually see who opened email invites, which is a good tool to use when you want to follow up with invitees for an RSVP.</span></p>
<h4><b>What information should you include in your soft opening invitation? </b></h4>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Include these key items in your invite for maximum impact:</span></p>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Location, date, time</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">RSVP instructions</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">A </span><a href="http://pressreleasezen.com/how-to-write-a-restaurant-grand-opening-press-release-sample-template-example/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span style="font-weight: 400;">press release</span></a> (<span style="font-weight: 400;">or a link to one) so that people and media can learn more about your restaurant</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">A link to your restaurant’s website</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Links to your restaurant&#8217;s social media accounts </span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Relevant social hashtags</span></li>
</ul>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Planning a soft opening can be simple when you have an organized checklist.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2 id="section4"><b>How to get value from a restaurant soft opening</b></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">So you’ve done all you can to prepare for your soft opening. All that’s left to do is open your doors and learn from what happens next. Here’s how to maximize the impact of your soft opening.</span></p>
<ol>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Gather feedback</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Perfect your service</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Build a marketing list</span></li>
</ol>
<h3><b>Gather feedback</b></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Think about your restaurant’s soft opening as a learning opportunity. Collect feedback so that you can improve and perfect your offerings before the official launch. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">You can collect feedback informally by asking guests how they are enjoying the food during your soft launch party or trial period. You can formalize feedback by asking guests for anonymous feedback through a survey. People usually don’t want to provide feedback without an incentive, so offer a coupon or raffle away a compelling prize in exchange for their input. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">What should you ask about? Ask customers what they think about:</span></p>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Food quality</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Menu variety </span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Menu clarity</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Price point</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Ambiance</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Service</span></li>
</ul>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Listening to your customers will take your restaurant far.</span></p>
<h3><b>Perfect your service</b></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Use the soft opening to perfect customer service. Observe staff closely to see who needs more training, what things need to be sped up, what cadence of service your customers want, etc.</span></p>
<h3><b>Build your marketing list</b></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Get your soft opening visitors to opt-in to your marketing communications. When you can send them </span><a href="/pos/restaurant/loyalty/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span style="font-weight: 400;">coupons via email</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> or updates about new offerings via SMS, you’ll be more likely to turn them into regulars.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Offer customers an incentive, like a coupon or a free side or beverage, to opt-in to your marketing list.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2><b>Rock your restaurant’s soft opening</b></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A soft opening gives your restaurant an opportunity to generate buzz, start a loyal following, and perfect the kinks without the pressure of advertising that you’re open and ready for business. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Have a successful soft launch by planning your menu and pricing strategically, preparing your staff, and choosing when to have a soft opening. If you plan to host an invite-only party, invite the right people in the right way.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Focus on gathering feedback, perfecting your service, and building your marketing list during the soft opening to maximize its impact. Congratulations on opening a restaurant!  </span></p>

Restaurant sales grew from</span><a href="https://www.restaurant.org/research/restaurant-statistics/restaurant-industry-facts-at-a-glance" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"> <span style="font-weight: 400;">$825 billion in 2018</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> to <a href="https://www.nrn.com/sales-trends/us-restaurant-sales-reach-record-863b-2019-nra-says" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">$863 billion in 2019</a>. That growth is largely in part to restaurateurs increasing their margins and approaching their <strong>menu design</strong> more strategically.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">There’s no doubt that the restaurant industry is on the upswing. Customers are spending more, which is a great opportunity for you to capitalize on. But when there’s an opportunity, there’s typically fierce competition.</span> <span style="font-weight: 400;"><a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/sageworks/2018/01/26/restaurants-margins-are-fatter-but-competition-is-fierce/#2212c16f27f9" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">About 60,000</a> new restaurants open annually in the US, with 50,000 closing</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">—a net gain of 10,000 new restaurants </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">(read: new competitors)</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> per year.</span></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2 id="section1"><b>How to design a profitable restaurant menu</b></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Your menu should represent the spirit of your establishment, stand out from the competition and scale your profits. To do that, we&#8217;ve broken menu design into five actionable steps: </span></p>
<ol>
<li>Analyze your sales reports</li>
<li>Create a menu matrix</li>
<li>Adjust menu item prices</li>
<li>Select which dishes to feature</li>
<li>Choose your menu layout carefully</li>
</ol>
<h3 id="section1"><strong>1. Analyze your sales reports</strong></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">This first step is the most important—to improve your menu, you need to base your decisions on data. Data is the best way to quantify your menu’s effectiveness, grow profits and measure results. Thankfully, your point of sale should be able to pull intuitive </span><a href="https://www.lightspeedhq.com/pos/restaurant/pos-makes-smart-decisions/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">sales reports</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> without a hitch.</span></p>
<p><strong>Note:</strong><span style="font-weight: 400;"> If you’ve yet to open your restaurant and have no historical sales data, you can skip directly to Step 3, which focuses on pinpointing how to price menu items to account for the cost of goods sold (COGS), labor and overhead expenses while still turning a profit with each sale. </span></p>
<p><img class="wp-image-56169 aligncenter" src="https://assets.lightspeedhq.com/img/2019/01/03ae3ce4-sales.001.jpeg" alt="" width="800" height="378" /></p>
<h4><b>For example</b></h4>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Imagine this is your appetizer menu’s monthly sales data.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Your sales data indicates that the butternut squash soup is popular and could probably earn you more profit, so you decide to raise the selling price from $5.00 to $5.95, a boost that you don’t think will negatively impact its sales volume. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">You also raise the selling price of the popular tuna tataki dish by $2.00 and decrease your lobster cake’s price by $1.05, which you project will increase its sales by 50%.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Before adjusting the selling prices of these menu items, your total monthly gross sales were $1,249.00. Assuming your monthly sales of these menu items remain consistent, your total gross sales after adjusting their selling prices will be $1396.25. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">That’s 147.25 in additional revenue per month and </span><span style="color: #008000;"><b>$1,767.00</b></span><b> per year!</b></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">And that’s only from adjusting three menu items. Repeat this exercise for each of your popular menu items to raise that number even further. </span></p>

</div>
<h3><strong>2. Create a menu matrix</strong></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Now that you have a good understanding of your menu item’s profitability, the next step is to create a chart to categorize each menu item based on its sales volume (popularity) and profitability.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">We call this chart a </span>menu matrix.</p>
<h4><b>What is a menu matrix? </b></h4>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A menu matrix is an instant visual aid used to map out the sales volume and gross income of each menu item you sell. Simply put, it helps you get a clearer understanding of which menu items are the most important for your establishment’s financials (and which drinks you want to draw the most attention to using menu design tricks, but we’ll cover that in </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Step 5</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">). </span></p>
<h4><b>How to create a menu matrix</b></h4>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Start by plotting your current menu items on an X and Y axis based on their popularity and profitability. Each item falls into one of these four categories:</span></p>
<ul>
<li><b>Cash cows: </b><span style="font-weight: 400;">Low profit, highly popular menu items. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Customers love these menu items, but they aren’t profitable—yet. Consider adjusting their prices as we did with the Pimms Cup and Mojito. If the cocktail continues to be very popular, you just created a star menu item.</span></li>
<li><b>Stars: </b><span style="font-weight: 400;">High profit, popular menu items. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">You want to draw as much attention to these menu items as possible. Along with emphasizing them in your menu design, have bartenders and servers suggest them to indecisive customers.</span></li>
<li><b>Duds: </b><span style="font-weight: 400;">Low profit, low popularity menu items. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">You don’t need to cut these items from your menu per se. Sometimes reworking either their price or their ingredients is all you need to turn them into stars. </span><a href="/blog/getting-to-know-your-customers/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Ask customers for feedback</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> to see how you can tweak it and then see what customers think of the reworked recipe. Is it a hit or a miss? If sales remain low, consider removing the item from your menu altogether.</span></li>
<li><b>Puzzles: </b><span style="font-weight: 400;">High profit, low popularity menu items. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Consider renaming this item, changing the way it’s described in your menu or having your servers and bartenders suggest it to guests more often to drive sales. These items have untapped potential.</span></li>
</ul>
<p><img class="aligncenter wp-image-56162" src="https://assets.lightspeedhq.com/img/2019/01/c0cf88fa-image-2019-01-30-at-11.33.47-am.png" alt="restaurant-menu-matrix" width="600" height="587" /></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Once you complete this exercise, you’ll have a clear understanding of which menu items to prioritize, rework or remove from your menu to maximize sales and profits. </span></p>
<h3><strong>3. Adjust your menu item prices</strong></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Imagine you sold a high volume of your cash cows, stars and reworked puzzles, but were still operating your business at a loss. That’s exactly what we want to avoid. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Typically when this happens it’s due to having set prices that don’t cover COGS, labor and overhead expenses, as well as profit once all those expenses are paid for. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The markup of your menu items is largely influenced by your cost of goods sold, labor costs and overhead expenses (like your </span><a href="/blog/tips-for-leasing-restaurant-space/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span style="font-weight: 400;">commercial space’s lease</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">), each of which account for roughly one-third of your restaurant’s revenue each. </span></p>
<p><img class="aligncenter wp-image-59404 size-full" src="https://assets.lightspeedhq.com/img/2019/07/caeb9cf1-low-restaurant-profit-margins.jpg" alt="Pie chart of average restaurant expenses and profit" width="669" height="419" /></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Once all these expenses are paid, restaurants are usually only netting between 2% and 6% profit off of each sale. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Of course, your markup will also depend on your restaurant type. Fine-dining restaurants typically sell a lower volume of dishes and have a higher cost of goods sold. As a result, they charge more per dish. Alternatively, quick-service and fast-food restaurants sell a higher volume at a lower cost. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Calculate your total monthly expenses and determine your menu item prices so that you’re able to pay those expenses and still turn a profit at the end of each month.</span></p>

<h3 id="section4"><strong>4. Select which dishes to feature</strong></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Let’s dive into the psychology of choice.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Put simply, FOMO (fear of missing out) is a real thing and having too many menu items isn’t ideal. When confronted with too many options, customers have a harder time deciding what they want and are more likely to be unsatisfied with the choice they do make (“</span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">I wonder if I should have bought the tuna tataki instead?</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">”).</span></p>
<h3><img class="aligncenter wp-image-56186" src="https://assets.lightspeedhq.com/img/2019/01/95702e6f-wesual-click-719540-unsplash.jpg" alt="" width="800" height="532" /></h3>
<h4><strong>How many menu items should you have? </strong></h4>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A</span> study from<a href="https://www.researchgate.net/publication/263451672_Menu_Choice_Satisfaction_or_Overload" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Bournemouth University</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> found that the answer depends on what type of restaurant you run.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">For fast-food and quick-service restaurants, the sweet spot was six menu items per category (starters, fish, chicken, steaks and burgers, grills and classic meat dishes, pasta, vegetarian, and desserts). For fine-dining and sit-down restaurants, the sweet spot was seven starters and desserts, with ten main courses.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Remember the menu matrix from before? Here’s where it comes in handy. Feature only your stars, cash cows, and re-worked puzzles on your menu. Your duds—the menu items that aren’t popular nor profitable—should be eliminated from your menu entirely. </span></p>
<h3 id="section5"><strong>5. Choose your menu layout carefully</strong></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A well-designed menu layout will </span>influence your guests’ purchasing, while clearly communicating your restaurant&#8217;s brand.<span style="font-weight: 400;"> Is there a specific high-revenue dish you want your customers to focus on? Your menu design can help make that happen. Here are the top things to consider in your menu design: </span></p>
<h4><b>Make a great first impression</b></h4>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Your menu, along with your restaurant’s interior design, are what communicates your restaurant’s brand to guests loud and clear. You need to make sure that the visual aesthetic of your menu corresponds to your restaurant’s image and what kind of dining experience you want your guests to have.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">According to a Gallup poll, the average guest only scans a menu for approximately</span><a href="https://pdfs.semanticscholar.org/db3b/5526f250fa3c00b73f0a16d161dcf600f7be.pdf" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer"> <span style="font-weight: 400;">109 seconds</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. That means your menu has a little over one minute to make a great first impression. Assume you don’t have your guests’ undivided attention and design your menu to be as easy to scan as possible. Use clear section headings, short dish descriptions, and clean, minimal design.</span></p>
<h4><b>Plan out your menu item placement  </b></h4>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Ideally, your guests should see all of your menu items at a glance. Two-page menus are the most ideal format. It gives you enough space to lay out all your dishes in a way that’s easily scannable for guests.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">You’re going to want to break your menu down by sections: entrees, main courses, sides, and desserts. Alternatively, you can have a separate, smaller menu specifically for your desserts and cocktails. This minimizes clutter and gives your main menu more space to work with. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Consider using different font sizes or photos to make the dishes in your sweet spot stand out even more.</span></p>
<p><strong>Tip: </strong>Consider using different font sizes or photos to make the dishes in your sweet spot stand out even more.</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter wp-image-56179" src="https://assets.lightspeedhq.com/img/2019/01/973194d9-screen-shot-2019-01-30-at-7.40.28-pm.png" alt="" width="800" height="537" /><span style="font-weight: 400;">On a two-page menu, guests typically spend most of their time looking at the center of the right-hand side (known as your “sweet spot”), followed by the first and last items of each column. Place your highest-profit dishes and biggest sellers in these areas so that they’re the first thing your guests see.</span></p>
<h4><b>Emphasize your Stars and Cash Cows</b></h4>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Along with using sweet spots to your advantage, you can use “eye magnets” to draw your guests&#8217; attention towards certain dishes.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Eye magnets can be a photo of the dish, a graphic illustration, a differently colored box, a border, or any other attention-getter that makes that dish or area of the menu stand out from the rest.</span></p>
<h4><b>For example</b></h4>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">This menu groups the most expensive menu items together, surround them with a frame and includes graphic illustrations. The result? Your eye is intentionally drawn to that area of the menu first.</span></p>
<p><img class="wp-image-56183 size-full aligncenter" src="https://assets.lightspeedhq.com/img/2019/01/f1d412a9-sagos.jpeg" alt="" width="628" height="628" /></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><span style="color: #999999;"><em>Image source: <a style="color: #999999;" href="https://en.99designs.de/menu-design/contests/upscale-menu-design-tavern-restaurant-las-vegas-848004" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">99designs.com</a></em></span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Be strategic with which menu items you use eye magnets for. The more you use, the less impact they have. Limit yourself to one eye magnet per menu category (appetizers, entrees, main courses, etc). With that in mind, try only using eye magnets for your Star and Cash Cow items.</span></p>
<h4><b>Use photos and graphic elements wisely</b></h4>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The volume of photos you use in your menu, along with the overall effectiveness of those photos, depends on what type of restaurant you’re running.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Pairing every menu item with a photo is commonly associated with fast food, low price point establishments. That’s why high-end restaurants tend to avoid oversaturating their menu with photos—they don’t want their restaurant to come off as looking cheap. Alternatively, If you want your restaurant to look high-end and are cautious about using photos, consider using graphic illustrations instead.</span></p>
<p><img class="wp-image-56163 aligncenter" src="https://assets.lightspeedhq.com/img/2019/01/3b92f6ae-alchemy_photo_01.jpg" alt="" width="628" height="942" /></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><span style="color: #999999;"><em>     Here, <a style="color: #999999;" href="https://www.underconsideration.com/artofthemenu/archives/alchemy.php" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">Alchemy</a> shows how to use graphic illustrations and have great visual results.</em></span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Menu Engineer Gregg Rapp reports that </span>for mid-range, affordable restaurants,  featuring one image per page can increase sales of that item by <a href="https://www.menucoverdepot.com/resource-center/articles/restaurant-menu-engineering/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">as much as 30%</a><strong>.</strong><span style="font-weight: 400;"> So if you’re going to use a photo, consider using them wisely and featuring the dishes you want to draw more attention to.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Low-quality images defeat the purpose of featuring a photo in the first place. They can make your food look less appealing than it actually is. If you feature images, ensure that they capture the dishes ingredients, colors, and textures—and don’t forget presentation! Take the time to plate each dish.</span><a href="https://www.shutterstock.com/blog/5-food-photographers-art-high-end-plating" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer"> <span style="font-weight: 400;">All the pros are doing it</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2 id="section2"><b>How to write a restaurant menu</b></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">You want your menu to be as easy to read and understand as possible while describing each dish in a way that sounds interesting and enticing to your guests. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Your challenge is to keep the number of words you use to a minimum while ensuring that each word is necessary and has an impact. Here’s how:</span></p>
<ol>
<li>Write air-tight menu item descriptions</li>
<li>Use descriptive adjectives</li>
<li>Mention the origins of ingredients</li>
<li>Don&#8217;t use dollar signs</li>
<li>Shift attention away from price</li>
<li>Use decoys</li>
</ol>
<h3><b>1. Write air-tight meal descriptions</b></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Make sure that descriptions are short and to the point.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Your customers may be short on time, so a lengthy description will only make your menu harder to read and slow down your table turnover rate. Try to describe each meal in two lines. Focus on the necessary information: its ingredients, flavor, texture, and origins.</span></p>
<h3><b>2. Use descriptive adjectives </b></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Adjectives are your friend as long as you use them in moderation. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">They help your guests imagine the texture, appearance, and taste of each meal. For instance, words like rich, creamy, smooth, and zesty paint a nice picture. You want your copy to ignite their senses.</span></p>
<h3><b>3. Mention the origins of ingredients</b></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Mention where your ingredients come from, whether they’re locally sourced or from another region. “Sun-ripened Italian tomatoes” sounds a lot more enticing than just “tomatoes”, doesn’t it?</span></p>
<p><img class="aligncenter wp-image-56181" src="https://assets.lightspeedhq.com/img/2019/01/ecce5773-jakub-kapusnak-296128-unsplash.jpg" alt="" width="800" height="533" /></p>
<h3><b>4. Don’t use dollar signs</b></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Dollar signs cause your guests to choose the </span><a href="https://www.thrillist.com/eat/nation/restaurant-menu-secrets-menu-design" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer"><span style="font-weight: 400;">least expensive options</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Why? Because any currency symbol immediately makes your guests think about the pain associated with spending and inadvertently causes them to shop based on price, rather than what they </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">really</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> want.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Center for Hospitality Research discovered that</span><a href="https://scholarship.sha.cornell.edu/chrpubs/169/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"> <span style="font-weight: 400;">customers spend significantly more</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> when a menu doesn’t include dollar signs.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">You want your guests to pick the meals that stimulate their senses, regardless of price—and removing the dollar sign can help you discretely make that happen. </span></p>
<h3><b>5. Shift attention away from how much the dish costs</b></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Building off the last point, you want to avoid placing your menu item prices in an easily scannable column. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Why? Because it causes customers to focus on a meal’s price, which can result in them choosing the cheapest option. Instead, consider making your prices a little less visible and placing them beneath the dish&#8217;s description.</span></p>
<h3><b>6. Use decoys</b></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Another way to distract your guests from price is to use a decoy menu item. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Place an exceptionally expensive item within close proximity of the item you really want your guests to buy. The more expensive item makes all items around it seem like a more reasonable option, increasing the probability that they are chosen (which is exactly what you wanted in the first place).</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2 id="section3"><b>How to create a cocktail menu</b></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">If your restaurant has a </span><a href="/blog/restaurant-licenses-and-permits/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span style="font-weight: 400;">liquor license</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, you’re going to want a solid cocktail menu.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The same primary steps described above apply to profitable cocktail programs: analyze your sales data, create a menu matrix, adjust your cocktail prices and feature your stars, cash cows and re-worked puzzles. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">That’s how you assure that each cocktail is driving revenue.</span></p>
<h3><b>1. Analyze your cocktail sales reports </b></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">To improve your cocktail menu’s profitability, you first need to base your decisions on your historical sales data. Thankfully, your point of sale should be able to pull </span><a href="/pos/restaurant/pos-makes-smart-decisions/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span style="font-weight: 400;">intuitive sales reports</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> for a given timeframe. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">When determining a cocktail’s profitability, look at the total number of units sold, rather than the profitability of a single unit. High-profit items will not positively impact your business’s financials if you do not sell a high enough volume. </span></p>
<p><img class="aligncenter wp-image-59768" src="https://assets.lightspeedhq.com/img/2019/01/97e1704f-cocktail-menu-design-analyze-sales-100-e1566241158862.jpg" alt="Cocktail Menu Design Analyze Sales" width="800" height="416" /></p>
<h4><b>For example</b></h4>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Imagine this is your cocktail menu’s monthly sales data. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">That data indicates that both the Mojito and Pimms Cup are popular, so much so that you believe you can raise their selling price without negatively impacting their sales volume. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">You decide to raise the selling price of the Pimms Cup from </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">$6.50 to $9.00 and the selling price of the Mojito from $8.00 to $11.00. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Prior to adjusting their prices, your total gross sales for those two drinks was $398.50 per month. Assuming the sales volume for those cocktails remains consistent from month to month, those two price adjustments will raise your total gross sales from those two cocktails to $550—that’s over $150 sales per month and $1,800 per year!</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">And that’s only from adjusting </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">two</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> cocktails. Repeating this exercise for each of your popular menu items can raise profits exponentially. </span></p>
<h3><b>2. Adjust your cocktail prices </b></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Imagine you sold a high volume of your cash cows, stars and reworked puzzles, but were still operating your business at a loss. That’s exactly what we want to avoid. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Typically when this happens it’s due to having set prices that don’t cover COGS, labor and overhead expenses, as well as profit once all those expenses are paid for. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">To achieve this, we suggest marking up each cocktail’s selling price to be between </span><b>100% to 300% higher </b><span style="font-weight: 400;">than its COGS. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">That might sound like a big number, but that markup is going to cover a lot of expenses: COGS includes your garnishes, glasses, labor, rent, tools and even your cocktail napkins. In addition, each drink you sell needs to contribute to paying your commercial space’s lease, which can account for up to 30% of all revenue. </span></p>
<h4><b>For example</b></h4>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Let’s say you want to adjust the selling price of your Tom Collins (priced at $8.50), one of your establishment’s best sellers. Initially, you based your pricing strictly off the COGS plus 300%. </span></p>

<p><b>Actual cost: </b><span style="font-weight: 400;">$3.40 ÷ $8.50 = </span><span style="color: #ff0000;"><b>40%</b></span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Once you take labor, overhead and other expenses into account, your drink’s actual cost jumps by </span><b>10%. </b></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">If you mark up the </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">true</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> price of your Tom Collins by 300%, it’s sales price jumps from $8.50 to $10.20. That’s a difference of $1.70 per sale. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Considering you sold 67 Tom Collins last month, that’s </span><b>$113.90 in lost revenue</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">. When annualized, that’s a loss of $1,366.80!</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Even the number of napkins you use has an impact on the profit you get from a drink. Include these expenses in your</span><a href="/blog/how-to-calculate-restaurant-food-costs/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"> <span style="font-weight: 400;">selling prices</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> from the onset so that you can assure that you’re able to cover all your establishment’s expenses while still turning a profit. </span></p>
<h3><b>3. Select which cocktails to feature on the menu</b></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Of course, you should take special orders from guests if you have a bartender on staff. Your cocktail menu, however, should be reserved for the drinks you want to put direct emphasis on. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In fact, menus with fewer options are actually better. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Customers get overwhelmed when they’re presented with too many choices and, as a result, are less satisfied with the decisions they make (should I have ordered the Mojito instead of the Pimms Cup? This is also known as fear of missing out (FOMO). </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Remember the menu matrix from before? Here’s where it comes in handy. Feature only your stars, cash cows, and re-worked puzzles on your menu. Your duds—the menu items that aren’t popular nor profitable—should be eliminated from your menu entirely. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Chris Tanner, head barman at London hotspot </span><a href="http://www.thevaultsoho.co.uk/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer"><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Vault</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> has a few other considerations for creating an amazing cocktail menu:</span></p>
<h4><b>Stay true to your restaurant’s personality</b></h4>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Similar to your restaurant’s main menu and interior design, you want your cocktail menu to reflect your restaurant’s brand. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Don’t be afraid to be a little quirky—a unique cocktail menu can help you differentiate your </span><a href="/blog/what-do-customers-look-for-in-a-restaurant-experience/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span style="font-weight: 400;">establishment’s experience</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> from its competitors and develop a loyal customer base. Know what you want your restaurant to represent and commit to that vision. </span></p>
<h4><b>Stay on top of seasons and trends</b></h4>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">You want to give customers a reason to keep coming back time and time again. To do that, consider imbuing classic cocktails with a </span><a href="https://www.lightspeedhq.com/blog/increase-average-order-value-seasonal-restaurant-menu/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">special seasonal twist</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. It’s a simple way to refresh your menu without too much effort. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Is it cold and wintery outside? Perhaps a winter-spiced Negroni will do the trick. Summery? Forget the drinks that warm you up and go with a fruity Tom Collins. The trick to keeping your cocktail menu fresh is to add a seasonal element to the classics.</span></p>
<div style="background-color: #f7f7f7; line-height: 1.45; font-size: 1.125rem; margin-top: 30px; margin-bottom: 30px; border: 1px solid #e9e9eb; border-radius: 4px; padding: 30px 20px 30px 20px;">

</div>
<h4><b>Create a strong narrative </b></h4>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Your menu needs to be easy to read and have a clear narrative from beginning to end. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“It’s difficult to engage with a menu if it’s all over the place,” says Tanner. Like any writer, a pub owner needs to engage their customers with the story they’re trying to tell. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">One method for building a menu narrative is to have a theme that links everything together. For example, you can select ingredients that are related either by season or their country of origin. You could also base your theme on your establishment’s location. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Anything can be a theme, just make sure that it’s distinct and easy for your customers to understand. </span></p>
<p><img class="size-full wp-image-59767 aligncenter" src="https://assets.lightspeedhq.com/img/2019/01/216af549-the-vault-london-menu-design.png" alt="The Ultimate Guide to Restaurant Menu Design - Cocktail Menus" /></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">For example, The Vault is located underneath one of London’s oldest whiskey shops. They use their heritage location as inspiration for each of their drinks by elevating classic cocktails with subtle, modern twists. Each drink aligns with The Vault’s brand, which creates an even more cohesive guest experience. </span></p>
<h4><b>Produce quality over quantity </b></h4>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">For Chris, pub owners and operators should prioritize delivering quality over quantity; it’s the biggest factor in fostering loyal, repeat customers. This approach also enables you to raise your menu item prices. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Since the financial crisis, people are spending less often but actually spend more per outing. They want quality over quantity when they go out for a drink,” he says. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Using high-quality ingredients makes a big difference in a cocktail’s taste and quality. Choose high-quality spirits and fresh, seasonal fruit and herbs to bring a more intense flavor. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Of course, when you use high-quality ingredients, your COGS per menu item will also increase. If you choose to take this route, be sure to adjust your cocktail’s prices accordingly as we explained above.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2><b>Create a profitable restaurant menu</b></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The reason why many establishments fail is due to a poorly priced menu: from pricing and concept to which items it features. When executed haphazardly, these factors can be detrimental to your establishment’s </span><a href="/blog/complete-guide-to-restaurant-profit-margins/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span style="font-weight: 400;">profit margins.</span></a></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">By analyzing your sales data, creating a menu matrix, adjusting your menu item prices and carefully selecting which dishes and cocktails to feature, you can create a menu that’s both profitable and compelling for your customers—from seasoned foodies to first-time explorers.  </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">You have the information, you have the tools — you even have free customizable menu templates. You&#8217;re a menu design wizard. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Are you ready to build your perfect menu?</span></p>
