According to [TrueUpâ€™s](https://www.trueup.io/layoffs) tech layoff tracker, In 2022, there were 1,525 layoffs at tech companies, with 237,874 people impacted, and this data is not including small companies with a small staff. Behind the un-personalized and cold numbers, thousands of families are facing a difficult challenge, how to pay bills and how to find a job ASAP.
Unfortunately, 2023 keeps layoffs in pace with the last year, and to my deep sadness, my lovely Lightspeed was also affected by this trend.
