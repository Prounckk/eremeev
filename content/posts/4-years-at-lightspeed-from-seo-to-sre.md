This week I celebrate four years at Lightspeed. I'm very grateful to the Marketing team for having confidence in me and allowing me to be a part of this rocketship üöÄ.

I remember the first month. It's all was about excitement! Friday beer üçªüçªüçª, really? Can I really have a beer at work? New macbook (it was the first in my life), what? Team outing? What? Again beer? üçª No way! Can I get this tool for my work? What do you mean I don't have to get +100000 approvals and wait until IT install it? What do you mean I don't need to log every hour and meeting time?

After this "honeymoon," I've got clear understanding that all doesn't matter but results. When I was reading a review at Glassdoor, I saw "work hard, play hard," I didn't think this is so true. But we worked hard; we had crazy parties. Every month from zero to hero, to reach new goals and new horizons.

Four years passed, two successful IPOs, Multiple acquisitions, Pandemic, but we are still young and a little bit crazy. We have great corporate culture and outstanding leaders!

## Be Aware!
Please, stop reading right here. The following countless number letters will be about my journey from SEO to an SRE. You can find better reading here: https://medium.com/topic/programming

## From a shy SEO to a Lead Backend Developer
As an SEO Specialist, I was in charge of website optimization, organic traffic and, as a result - organic leads. SEO was, is, and will be a  field where you know the rules; you try to follow the rules, but nobody guarantees you good results. But, just try to become a heretic for a sec and challenge the rules; inquisition will be right here, penalities or manual actions will hit your site.
On the other hand, I had my projects, where I didn't code much but managed different services parts. Managed servers, installing Flussonic, WordPress and tons of others things.
### Mathematical problem
I loved dev work + I knew this a little bit + I didn't feel to do SEO all my life + I wanted to be more beneficial for the company than guessing guy = asked for dev work.
### Let`s code! 
My first code that went after to prod was committed on May 29, 2018. From this day, I count my real dev experience.
Fun fact: my first commit was about [count()](https://www.php.net/manual/en/function.count.php) function
![alt text](/2021/my-first-commit.png "$countFunctionFix is needed for php7+ where count() is showing warnings if the variable is not array")

Everything that I did before was pure cowboy-style programming: FTP to production server and coding... ü§¶ü§¶ü§¶

Day after day, month after month I was spending more time with PHPStrom and Vim than with ScreamingFrog and Excell. I've got a Scrum Master certification, was spending all my free time at Coursera, Pluralsight and Exercism.io.
I become an admin of our GitHub repo; I was doing releases and was a part-time scrum master at the web-dev team.
It was like this until one day when my friend and team-lead said he was leaving the company to build his startup. It was a moment of profound sadness... and the beginning of work as a Junior DevOps.
Since this day X, my life has changed completely. I was only one DevOps in the team, from nobody to a "bus factor" guy.  The responsibility and stress level reached the highest possible point. To archive balance in life, my self-esteem and self-confidence fell to the sub-sea level.

Time flies, thousands of lines of code were written, hundreds of bugs created, and I hope most of them fixed. It was amazing four years, and I'm sure this is just beginning!

Today, I'm writing this blog post, and I can't believe this happened for real. Four years ago, it was another person sitting at the job interview and saying that he wanted to grow as a marketing specialist; I saw myself as a Senior SEO Specialist in 5 years...  one more year left, haha.
