This is the first post created at Eremeev.CA. All devs start their journey with Hello World!
So do I.
This is not my first attempt to start a blog. I used to have one at [prounckk.wordpress.com](https://web.archive.org/web/20140427173309/https://prounckk.wordpress.com/). It was about my life in Canada and was created to share photos, impressions and thoughts with my friends that stayed in my country of origin.
But it was not the first one! Back in high school, I was a teenager that likes to write poems. Don't judge me; who didn't write poetry as a teenager!? I still remember the address: fried.to.kg, but unfortunately, web-archive didn't store any peace of my first ever blog.
* Front-End was HTML with tables and JS dynamic navigation! for the beginning of 2000, it was something!
* Back-End - I didn't even know about the existence of these things
* Hosting and DNS - managed by my friend; I hope he was not fired for giving me a subdomain of the corporate website.

## What is about?

I'll try my best to write here about my dev and personal experience. Please feel to subscribe or ignore this blog. It's up to you! 

## Why now?

I've just renewed the domain name, and I have no more excuse not to use it â€” the second and the main reason I want to learn rust and wasm. I bet there is no better way to learn new things than practice. 

## Tech stack

Back End of the site is managed by [Hugo](https://gohugo.io/), a static site generator written in Go.
As you might guess, for the first blog post, I didn't write any rust code, but I promise I will! Currently, the site is on my local but will be hosted soon at Cloudflare Workers with backup at Github pages. Read more about [how all this works](/posts/how-it-works/)!


Wish me luck!
